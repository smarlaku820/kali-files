# ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers)

- ISACs exchange IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- IOCs may include Yara rules, MD5s, IPs and more
- Some of the ISACs that help gather threat intelligence are:-
  - Alien Vault 
  - Threat Connect
  - MISP
- Data must be analyzed & must be actionable only then it can be called Threat Intelligence
- Adversaries are changing their TTP continously and therefore the TI landscape is also changing.

## Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence is also broken up into three different types.

- Strategic
  - Assist senior management make informed decisions specifically about the security budget and strategies.
- Tactical
  - Interacts with the TTPs and attack models to identify adversary attack patterns.
- Operational
  - Interact with IOCs and how the adversaries operationalize.
