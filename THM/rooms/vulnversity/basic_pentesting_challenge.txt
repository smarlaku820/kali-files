- run nmap
- run gobuster
- do an smbclient anonymous login
- find the user
- use hydra to bruteforce the password for the user
- now use the password to ssh into the server
- run LinEnum.sh & find any vectors for privilege escalation
- try to login to home directory of other user and find the .ssh folder
- try to get the private key & use john to crack the passphrase
- once you obtain the passphrase then you are good to go to find the .pass_bak inside the home directory itself, which reveals the password
