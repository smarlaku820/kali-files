## metasploit
`help`
`show`
`use expoit/<rest_of_the_path>`
`info` - to get info about the module or exploit.
`show options`
`show payloads`
`search type:auxiliary telnet`
`search type:auxiliary smtp`
You can use `show options` against a particular exploit & set those mandatory parameters.
`set RHOSTS <target_ip>` - across a single exploit or module
`set RHOSTS <target_ip>` - across all modules
Once all the module parameters are set, you can launch the module using the `exploit` command. Metasploit also supports the `run` command which is an alias created for `exploit` comman as the word exploit did not make sense when using modules that were not exploits (port scanners, vulnerability scanners, etc.,)

The `exploit` command can be used without any parameters or using the -z parameter.
The `exploit -z` command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens.


Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and metasploit.

You can use the `background` command to background the session prompt and go back to the `msfconsole` prompt.
You can run the `sessions` command to see active sessions.
You can use the `session -i <session_num>` to interact with that session
