# Network Services - (Vulns & thier exploitations)

We will cover, SMB/Telnet & FTP protocols.

- [SMB](./SMB.md)
- [telnet](./telnet.md)
- [FTP](./FTP.md)

## Understanding Proto
First step is to understand the protocol.

## Enumeration
- The second step is enumeration. enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.
- The process is essential for an attack to be successful.
- Enumeration can be used to gather
  - usernames
  - passwords
  - network information
  - hostnames
  - application data
  - services
  - any other information that is valuable to the attacker.
### Port Scanning
The first step of Enumeration is Port Scanning. You do that with NMAP.
