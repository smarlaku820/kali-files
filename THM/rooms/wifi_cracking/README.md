# Wifi Cracking

## Key Terms

- SSID: The network name that you see when you try and connect
- ESSID: An SSID that may apply to multiple access points, eg., a company office normally forming a bigger network.
- BSSID: An access point MAC address
- WPA2-PSK: Wifi network's that you connect to by providing a password that's same for everyone.
- WPA2-EAP: Wifi networks that you authenticate to by providing a username and password, which is sent to a RADIUS server
- RADIUS: A server for authenticating clients not just wifi

## Basics

- The core of WPA2 authentication is 4 way handshake. Most home wifi networks & many others use WPA(2) personal.
- If you login with password & its not WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy Standard), then its WPA(2) personal.
- WEP was insecure, after capturing enough packets to guess key via statistical methods.
