# Burp Suite Repeater

- We use repeater to manipulate & arbitrarily resend captured requests, as well as looking at some of the niftier options available.
- In short, we intercept the requests to a web application with the help of proxy & send the same request repeatedly as many number of times we want.
- This is ideal situation for anything to do around poking the endpoint
