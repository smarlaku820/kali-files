# Post Exploitation
- Enumeration with bloodhound and powerview
- Dumping hashes and golden ticket attacks with mimikatz.
- Basic information gathering with windows server tools and logs
- Basics of maintaining access with metasploit persistence module & creating a backdoor into the machine to get an instant meterpreter shell if the system is restarted or shutdown
- Lets gather some knowledge of how to approach a network after you have gained a shell on a machine.

## Powerview
- Its a great way to enumerate the domain after you have gained a shell on the system.

## BloodHound
- Graphical Interface that can help you map out the network
- SharpHound is used along with BloodHound where .json files from SharpHound are used within BloodHound to generate the Maps/GUI
- SharpHound is just like PowerView
- And then use this command,`Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain CONTROLLER.local -ZipFileName loot.zip`

## Maintaining Access   

- There are quite a few ways to maintain access on a machine or network. A fairly simple way is to maintain access is by setting up a meterpreter shell & then using a persistence metasploit module allowing us to create a backdoor service in the system that will give us an instant meterpreter shell if the machine is ever shutdown or reset.
- There are other ways of maintaining access such as advanced backdoors & rootkits however these are out of scope for now.





## References

- This room has given a good beginning with post-exploitation however there are a lot of other methods ever-evolving. I suggest to you to go out and do your own research find your own tools that you like to use for post-exploitation. I hope to make another room similar to this covering more advanced topics such as more in-depth backdoors and trojans, pivoting, token impersonation, and silver ticket attacks. I hope that this room has helped to give you a better understanding of how post-exploitation works in a real-world scenario.
