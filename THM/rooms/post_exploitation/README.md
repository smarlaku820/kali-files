- Enumeration with bloodhound and powerview
- Dumping hashes and golden ticket attacks with mimikatz.
- Basic information gathering with windows server tools and logs

## Powerview
- Its a great way to enumerate the domain after you have gained a shell on the system.

## BloodHound
- Graphical Interface that can help you map out the network
- SharpHound is used along with BloodHound where .json files from SharpHound are used within BloodHound to generate the Maps/GUI
